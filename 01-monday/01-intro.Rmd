# Introduction

## Who am I?

\columnsbegin
\column{0.6\linewidth}

- Ecologist & limnologist
    - Use palaeo as a tool
- Statistical ecologist
- Not an ecological statistician
- Used to teach the "ECRC Numerical Course" with John Birks
- Now a research scientist at IECS, U Regina
- Interested in
    - ecosystem response to environmental change
	- community dynamics
	- effects of N deposition on remote oligotrophic lakes
	- effects of nutrient enrichment on prarie lakes
	- C & N dynamics
	- statistical modelling

## Philosophy

We want to use methods that are

- ecologically plausible
- simple without being too simple
- not unduly complex

John Birks' legacy on quantiative palaeoecology

Yet as a field we haven't moved with the times --- squandering John's legacy

What was simple / not too complex 20 years ago may not be the best "simple-non-complex" way now

As a field we are crap at training

## Reproducibility

Who here could reproduce the analyses for their

- terminal degree disertation?
- last paper?

For a worrying example, see Richard Telford's blog for his ongoing attempts to reproduce results from Lake Żabińskie (LaroqueTobler et al, 2015, *QSR* **111** 35--50)
